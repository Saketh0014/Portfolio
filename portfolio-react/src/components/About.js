        <p>
          I'm a Computer Science graduate with a strong interest in Full Stack development, distributed systems, and intelligent applications. I enjoy designing scalable server-side architectures, building reliable APIs, and working with systems that involve real-time communication and AI-driven functionality.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most of my work revolves around technologies like Django, FastAPI, Flask, PostgreSQL, Supabase, Celery, Redis, Docker, and modern AI tools such as LLMs, LangChain, and vector databases. I love solving complex engineering problems, improving system performance, and creating platforms that are both efficient and intuitive.
